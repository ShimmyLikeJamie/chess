Game will basically consist of a board object filled with game pieces, also represented as objects

class Board
    x Has 8x8 grid, represented by 2d array 
    - Has two hashes for white & black graveyards
    x Has #display_board method
    - Has #take_turn method
    - Keeps track of which player's turn it is
end

class Game_Piece
    x Has tile variable showing what tile of the board it's on
    x Different class per game piece type
    - Each one will have a set of valid moves in an array which will be displayed to the player
    x Valid moves are calculated after before every move by using the tile it's on with its moveset
    - Knight will need its own method to calculate valid moves since it moves in an "L" shape
end

- Game simply is a loop until a player wins (king is taken or has no valid moves)
- If only two kings remain, game is a stalemate
- You should be able to bring back a piece from your graveyard if a pawn makes it to the end row
- Pawns can move forward two spaces at the beginning
