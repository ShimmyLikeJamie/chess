Woohoo, I'm gonna make Chess. You can find an abstract "specs.txt" file that kind of goes over my approach.

At the end of this project you should be able to simply run ruby on a "chess.rb" file and play the game. I'm going to do my best to make it intuitive enough that you can just play and everything should be fairly self explanatory.
